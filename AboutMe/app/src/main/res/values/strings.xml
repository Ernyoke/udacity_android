    <string name="bio">Alan Olav Walker (born 24 August 1997), formerly known by his stage name DJ Walkzz,
        is a British Norwegian record producer and DJ. He is best known for his 2015 single "Faded", which
        received platinum certifications in over 10 countries. He was ranked 36th on DJ Mag\'s Top 100 DJs
        list of 2018, placing 19 positions lower than the previous year.\n
        Walker is a son of Hilde Omdal Walker, a Norwegian, and Philip Alan Walker, an Englishman. By birth,
        he was granted dual citizenship on the basis of his parental origin. At the age of two, he moved to Bergen,
        Norway with his parents and sister. Walker grew up with two siblings, an older sister, Camilla Joy, born
        in England, and a younger brother, Andreas, born in Norway after the family moved from the United Kingdom.\n
        Growing up in the digital era, Walker found an early interest in computers, which later turned into a
        fascination for programming and graphic design. He initially had no musical background; however, he
        later taught himself by watching tutorials on YouTube based on music production.
